# Impacts of the Pandemic on Phoenix Housing
​
## Summary
Being interested in the housing market from a personal perspective, our team decided to seek out answers to a few questions about the Phoenix housing market:
​
1.  Did the Pandemic have an effect on the availability of housing (in the owner and rental markets)?
2.  Did the Pandemic affect housing prices?
3.  Did the Pandemic usher in institutional investors thereby displacing homes for rent by individual homeowners?
​
## Slide 1:  the Phoenix market
​
Visual:  most recent 300 properties sold in the Phoenix area:

​
- Observations:  As is to be expected, single family homes are the predominant residential properties being listed and sold.
- The average price of single residential homes is $_________ based on this sampling.
- Data extraction & cleaning:  The data underlying this graphic was the one of the more difficult data sets that we acquired and cleaned.  It required creating a dataframe via iteration from a data-intensive JSON file.

## Slides 2 and 3:  heat map of Phoenix housing and rental market

- Legend for the heat maps - the larger the circle, the more square footage for the property.  The darker the circle, the more expensive the property.

## Slides 3 and 4: all homes for sale on the market
​<https://github.com/Mun-Min/Project_One/blob/main/Visuals%20PNG/all_home_sales_2019_2022..png>

- Note, the peak of inventory was in Sept 2019, falling shortly to a depth in June 2020, 3 months after the pandemic was declared by WHO.  The inventory of houses on the market are approximately half, compared to 2/19.


- This graphic brings up a few questions:

    - is this due to slower housing starts?

    - more people working from home?

    - the home inventory is shrinking, but yet 200 people a day are still moving to Phoenix area.

## Slide 5: Price Per Square Foot By Year

- March 2020 $178/sf

- Dec 2020 $200/sf

- April 2021 $225/sf

- Jan 2022 $263/sf

- May 2022 $293/sf
​
## Slide 6:  Investor purchases of rentals vs. total rentals
​<https://github.com/Mun-Min/Project_One/blob/main/Visuals%20PNG/total_sales_and_investor_purchases.png>

- During the times of the pandemic and afterwards, the ratio of investor purchases seemed to be in line and parellel with owner-occupant purchases month in and month out.
